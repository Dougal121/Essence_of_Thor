The ESP32 version is born

26/02/2023   LoRa First cut working using TTGO boards
05/03/2023   LoRa working but dissappointing range (200m ish) adding more radio "stuff" to experiment with
20/01/2024   Changes so I can run without LoRa ... make sure WiFi power management can be turned off
21/01/2024   Another 23 hrs of my life wasted chasing down bugs ! But the ancillary stuff does work better. core working fine
